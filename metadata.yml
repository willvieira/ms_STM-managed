title: "Paying colonization credit with forest management could accelerate northward range shift of temperate trees"
running_title: "Management could accelerate tree range shifts"
abstract: "The northward migration of several tree species ranges is likely to lag behind climate change due to slow demography, competitive interactions and dispersal limitations. These will result in a colonization credit, where suitable climate envelopes are left unoccupied, and extinction debt, where tree stands persist at unsuitable climatic locations. While the underlying mechanisms explaining the delayed range shift of forest trees have been investigated, few studies have focused on how to overcome this lag. Here we extend a forest community state model derived from the metapopulation theory and calibrated with over 40,000 forest inventory plots, to formulate how forest management can accelerate the response of the boreal-temperate ecotone following warming temperature. We first established a general framework to represent how forest management affects the colonization/extinction processes driving four forest states: Boreal, Temperate, Mixed and Regeneration. We then simulated the potential of forest management to reduce colonization credit and extinction debt using two complementary approaches to measure the resilience and range shift of the boreal-temperate ecotone after warming temperature. Our simulations reveal that paying the colonization credit by planting temperate tree in regeneration or in boreal stands are likely to i) reduce the time the forest states takes to return to equilibrium, ii) increase forest resilience, and iii) move the ecotone northward. Surprisingly, harvesting boreal trees in boreal or mixed stands aiming to reduce extinction debt and open place to temperate trees colonize, were not effective. Our results suggest that forest management could help the boreal-temperate ecotone keep pace with climate change. This theoretical investigation supported by long-term data provides new insights to design future experiments testing the potential of forest management to adapt to climate change."
