abstract = {In theoretical studies, the most commonly used measure of ecological stability
is resilience: ecosystems asymptotic rate of return to equilibrium after a
pulse-perturbation -or shock. A complementary notion of growing popularity is reactivity:
the strongest initial response to shocks. On the other hand, empirical stability is often
quantified as the inverse of temporal variability, directly estimated on data, and
reflecting ecosystems response to persistent and erratic environmental disturbances. It is
unclear whether and how this empirical measure is related to resilience and reactivity.
Here, we establish a connection by introducing two variability-based stability measures
belonging to the theoretical realm of resilience and reactivity. We call them intrinsic,
stochastic and deterministic invariability; respectively defined as the inverse of the
strongest stationary response to white-noise and to single-frequency perturbations. We prove
that they predict ecosystems worst response to broad classes of disturbances, including
realistic models of environmental fluctuations. We show that they are intermediate measures
between resilience and reactivity and that, although defined with respect to persistent
perturbations, they can be related to the whole transient regime following a shock, making
them more integrative notions than reactivity and resilience. We argue that invariability
measures constitute a stepping stone, and discuss the challenges ahead to further unify
theoretical and empirical approaches to stability.},

abstract = {Studies of ecosystem responses to climate change often focus on potential equilibria in species or community distributions, overlooking the transitions to new equilibrium states. Transient phases can however last for decades or centuries, during which both demography and interspecific interactions are expected to play a crucial role. Here, we investigate the response of vegetation to climate warming at high latitudes involving a shift from open vegetation to either boreal (mainly coniferous) or temperate (mainly deciduous) forests. We specifically address how interactions among browsers and vegetation could affect the shift in dominance of vegetation type after climate warming. We characterize the transient dynamics using five measures: 1) asymptotic resilience, i.e. the rate at which equilibrium is restored, 2) initial resilience, the short-term rate of change of the ecosystem after climate change, 3) ecosystem exposure, i.e. the shift of the equilibrium due to climate change, 4) sensitivity, or the time to recover equilibrium, and 5) vulnerability, measured as the cumulative amount of changes in vegetation states during the transient phase. We find that plant–herbivore interactions usually extend the length of the transient period and induce more cumulative changes in vegetation types. This result implies that the consideration of multiple interacting species is necessary to provide robust scenarios of how ecosystems will respond to global changes. We furthermore show that plant–herbivore interactions disrupt the correlation between the five measures characterizing the transient dynamics, highlighting the need for a full multidimensional characterization of transients.},
