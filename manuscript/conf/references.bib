abstract = {In theoretical studies, the most commonly used measure of ecological stability
is resilience: ecosystems asymptotic rate of return to equilibrium after a
pulse-perturbation -or shock. A complementary notion of growing popularity is reactivity:
the strongest initial response to shocks. On the other hand, empirical stability is often
quantified as the inverse of temporal variability, directly estimated on data, and
reflecting ecosystems response to persistent and erratic environmental disturbances. It is
unclear whether and how this empirical measure is related to resilience and reactivity.
Here, we establish a connection by introducing two variability-based stability measures
belonging to the theoretical realm of resilience and reactivity. We call them intrinsic,
stochastic and deterministic invariability; respectively defined as the inverse of the
strongest stationary response to white-noise and to single-frequency perturbations. We prove
that they predict ecosystems worst response to broad classes of disturbances, including
realistic models of environmental fluctuations. We show that they are intermediate measures
between resilience and reactivity and that, although defined with respect to persistent
perturbations, they can be related to the whole transient regime following a shock, making
them more integrative notions than reactivity and resilience. We argue that invariability
measures constitute a stepping stone, and discuss the challenges ahead to further unify
theoretical and empirical approaches to stability.},

abstract = {Studies of ecosystem responses to climate change often focus on potential equilibria in species or community distributions, overlooking the transitions to new equilibrium states. Transient phases can however last for decades or centuries, during which both demography and interspecific interactions are expected to play a crucial role. Here, we investigate the response of vegetation to climate warming at high latitudes involving a shift from open vegetation to either boreal (mainly coniferous) or temperate (mainly deciduous) forests. We specifically address how interactions among browsers and vegetation could affect the shift in dominance of vegetation type after climate warming. We characterize the transient dynamics using five measures: 1) asymptotic resilience, i.e. the rate at which equilibrium is restored, 2) initial resilience, the short-term rate of change of the ecosystem after climate change, 3) ecosystem exposure, i.e. the shift of the equilibrium due to climate change, 4) sensitivity, or the time to recover equilibrium, and 5) vulnerability, measured as the cumulative amount of changes in vegetation states during the transient phase. We find that plant–herbivore interactions usually extend the length of the transient period and induce more cumulative changes in vegetation types. This result implies that the consideration of multiple interacting species is necessary to provide robust scenarios of how ecosystems will respond to global changes. We furthermore show that plant–herbivore interactions disrupt the correlation between the five measures characterizing the transient dynamics, highlighting the need for a full multidimensional characterization of transients.},

abstract = {The distributions of many terrestrial organisms are currently shifting in latitude or elevation in response to changing climate. Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.},

Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52{\%} of sites with only 1{\%} reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints.},

Climate change is shifting ranges and altering forest productivity. Disturbance regimes are changing with the potential for novel interactions among disturbance types. In some areas, forest management practices are intensifying, whereas in other areas, lower-impact ecological methods are being used. Interactions among these changing factors are likely to alter ecosystem structure and function at regional to continental scales. A macrosystems approach is essential to assessing the broadscale impacts of these changes and quantify cross-scale interactions, emergent patterns, and feedbacks. A promising line of analysis is the assimilation of data with ecosystem models to scale processes to the macrosystem and generate projections based on alternative scenarios. Analyses of these projections can characterize the range of future variability in forest function and provide information to guide policy, industry, and science in a changing world.},

At local scales, the distribution of many species is influenced by the interplay of the three factors of habitat availability, local extinctions and colonization dynamics. We use the standard Levins metapopulation model to illustrate how gradients in these three factors can generate species' range limits. We suggest that the three routes to range limits have radically different evolutionary implications. Because the Levins model makes simplifying assumptions about the spatial coupling of local populations, we present numerical studies of spatially explicit metapopulation models that complement the analytical model. The three routes to range limits give rise to distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Range limits in one species can also arise because of environmental gradients impinging upon other species. We briefly discuss a predator–prey example, which illustrates indirect routes to range limits in a metacommunity context.},

abstract = {Global climate change is already having an impact on species ranges. For species with slow demography and limited disper- sal, such as trees, lags between climate change and distribution shifts are likely to increase in the future. Such lags can be of critical importance to management and biodiversity of forests, because they can result in ‘extinction debts', where populations temporarily persist under unsuitable conditions, and ‘colonization credits', where suitable locations are not occupied owing to slow demography and limited dispersal. Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinc- tion debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion. B},

@article{Zhu2014,
abstract = {Tree species are predicted to track future climate by shifting their geographic distributions, but climate-mediated migrations are not apparent in a recent continental-scale analysis. To better understand the mechanisms of a possible migration lag, we analyzed relative recruitment patterns by comparing juvenile and adult tree abundances in climate space. One would expect relative recruitment to be higher in cold and dry climates as a result of tree migration with juveniles located further poleward than adults. Alternatively, relative recruitment could be higher in warm and wet climates as a result of higher tree population turnover with increased temperature and precipitation. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data at regional scales, we jointly modeled juvenile and adult abundance distributions for 65 tree species in climate space of the eastern United States. We directly compared the optimal climate conditions for juveniles and adults, identified the climates where each species has high relative recruitment, and synthesized relative recruitment patterns across species. Results suggest that for 77{\%} and 83{\%} of the tree species, juveniles have higher optimal temperature and optimal precipitation, respectively, than adults. Across species, the relative recruitment pattern is dominated by relatively more abundant juveniles than adults in warm and wet climates. These different abundance-climate responses through life history are consistent with faster population turnover and inconsistent with the geographic trend of large-scale tree migration. Taken together, this juvenile-adult analysis suggests that tree species might respond to climate change by having faster turnover as dynamics accelerate with longer growing seasons and higher temperatures, before there is evidence of poleward migration at biogeographic scales.},

abstract = {Rising global temperatures are suggested to be drivers of shifts in tree species ranges. The resulting changes in community composition may negatively impact forest ecosystem function. However, long-term shifts in tree species ranges remain poorly documented. We test for shifts in the northern range limits of 16 temperate tree species in Quebec, Canada, using forest inventory data spanning three decades, 15° of longitude and 7° of latitude. Range shifts were correlated with climate warming and dispersal traits to understand potential mechanisms underlying changes. Shifts were calculated as the change in the 95th percentile of latitudinal occurrence between two inventory periods (1970–1978, 2000–2012) and for two life stages: saplings and adults. We also examined sapling and adult range offsets within each inventory, and changes in the offset through time. Tree species ranges shifted predominantly northward, although species responses varied. As expected shifts were greater for tree saplings, 0.34 km yr−1, than for adults, 0.13 km yr−1. Range limits were generally further north for adults compared to saplings, but the difference diminished through time, consistent with patterns observed for range shifts within each life stage. This suggests caution should be exercised when interpreting geographic range offsets between life stages as evidence of range shifts in the absence of temporal data. Species latitudinal velocities were on average {\textless}50{\%} of the velocity required to equal the spatial velocity of climate change and were mostly unrelated to dispersal traits. Finally, our results add to the body of evidence suggesting tree species are mostly limited in their capacity to track climate warming, supporting concerns that warming will negatively impact the functioning of forest ecosystems.

abstract = {1.The future of temperate forests in the face of global change and anthropogenic stressors remains uncertain. The regeneration stage, which is a critical bottleneck for many organisms, is a key indicator of forest health, future canopy composition, and forest adaptive capacity. 2.In trees, seemingly healthy forests can be at long‐term risk due to insufficient juveniles to replace them (regeneration failure), or compositional differences between juveniles and adults (regeneration mismatch). We propose ‘regeneration debt' to collectively describe regeneration failure and mismatch in analogy to extinction debt. To demonstrate this concept, we conducted a macroecological analysis of regeneration debt and anthropogenic stressors in eastern US forests. 3.Using U.S. Forest Service‐Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, we quantified regeneration debt in 18 states from Maine to South Carolina, and evaluated the influence of site, anthropogenic stressors and climate drivers in the most affected regions. 4.We identified three distinct regions, with little debt in the north, moderate debt in the south, and severe regeneration debt in the central, mid‐Atlantic region. In this region, multiple anthropogenic stressors (invasive plants, deer overabundance, and land use) were associated with both low regeneration abundance and the prevalence of disease‐prone and/or suboptimal species. 5.Synthesis and applications. Without management intervention, the severe regeneration debt in the mid‐Atlantic region will likely lead to long‐term declines in forest cover, with cascading negative effects on forest‐dependent taxa and ecosystem services. Moreover, the location of the regeneration debt, which is at the northern edge of and involves many of the tree species that are predicted to gain suitable habitat in the Northeastern US, has consequences that extend far beyond its current geographic extent. In fact, this regeneration debt may already be functioning as a barrier to poleward tree migration. Our results demonstrate the value of regeneration debt as an indicator of ecosystem health and forest adaptive capacity.},
